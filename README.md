# LetsPrep

Lets Prep is quick search for recipes under 30 minutes that will stick to your set goal calorie intake. 

## Summary 

Lets Prep was made with HTML, CSS, Materialize, Edamam API, and a Sequelize Database. I was the Front End developer on a team of 5.

### Home Page

On the home page there is the enter button to enter into the next page. If we were to have more time we would have a module that allowed for users to sign in after hitting enter. There is a How It Works and Why Lets Prep sections on this page for Users who are just visiting the page for the first time and are not sure of it. The hamburger nav bar is sticky and has the option of going to the different sections of this page.

### Plan Your Meal Page

The Plan Your Meal page is currently where you are able to do the major application functions at. To start, the User inputs their information from name, email, goals, and your goal calorie input. After you hit the submit button, three meals would appear in the bottom component. You can pick one of the three meals and the reciepe you pick would go to the right component with the picture, the ingredients, and a link to the reciepe. 

Some improvements to this page we wish to make is being able to pick a reciepe for all three meals in a day and fix the CSS to make it prettier.

### Profile Page

The profile page is a future improvements page. We hope to have it so once you pick out meals, you will be able to see what meals you picked on a calendar. The left component is to show the users profile information from a picture and the goals the user may have.
